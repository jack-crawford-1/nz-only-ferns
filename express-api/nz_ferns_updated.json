    "recognition": "Abrodictyum caudatum is distinguished from T. elongatum and T. strictum by its epiphytic habit, creeping rhizome, lamina segments with a clearly defined border, and campanulate indusia which are widened at the mouth. It is superficially similar to, and occupies the same habitat as, T. venosum, but can be distinguished by its bordered lamina segments, obtuse apices which are never emarginate, and ultimate lamina segments with a single unbranched vein. It is also superficially similar to T. humile but can be distinguished by the unistratose border of short cells with transverse end-walls.",
    "notes": "Trichomanes caudatum (as Abrodictyum) from the Kermadec Islands was given a conservation status of Naturally Uncommon by de Lange et al. (2013), but they treated the Kerikeri population as a separate indeterminate taxon, \"Abrodictyum aff. caudatum\", which was listed as Nationally Critical.\nIn the classification of Ebihara et al. (2006), Trichomanes caudatum is treated as Abrodictyum caudatum.\n\nThere are differences between the Kerikeri and Raoul plants. The fronds of the Kerikeri plants grow downwards against the substrate, whereas Raoul plants appear slightly more upright. The indusia are more obviously flared in the Kerikeri plants, whereas the very few present in the Raoul material appear to be more truncate. Also the plants on Raoul grow at a much higher altitude than those at Kerikeri. Whether the two populations belong to the same species is uncertain.\n\nFronds of Trichomanes caudatum in New Zealand are much smaller and less divided than those in Australia or the Pacific. Nevertheless the cell structure of the lamina and the shape of the indusia suggest that they are correctly referred to this species. In Northland, the species is on the very southern edge of its distribution and the plants are probably poorly developed compared to those in tropical regions. DNA sequencing (Perrie et al. 2016) indicates that the Kerikeri plants group with those in Fiji, French Polynesia, and Australia. However, it also indicates that New Caledonian material of T. caudatum is different to that in Fiji, French Polynesia, and Australia, suggesting that more than one species may be present in the Pacific region."

However, the only specimens in BM from Cunningham’s herbarium are labelled \"Bay of Islands, New Zealand, May 1838\" and \"New Zealand, A. Cunningham\". Both of these are in conflict with the protologue, and hence Allan’s statement cannot be regarded as a lectotypification.

This specimen is the holotype (Brownsey & Perrie 2016).\n\nCroxall (1975) considered that Trichomanes elongatum (as Selenodesmium elongatum) occurred in Queensland and New South Wales, although he conceded that the distinctions between it and S. dentatum (widespread in the Pacific) and S. obscurum (from Asia, Australia and the western Pacific) were far from clear. Bostock & Spokes (1998) recognised only the latter species in Australia (as Cephalomanes obscurum), leaving Trichomanes elongatum as endemic to New Zealand.

Glabrous and hairy plants were sometimes\nfound in the same population. In his original description of A. diaphanum, Blume (1828) noted that the\npinnae were glabrous. Price (1990) further noted that “all plants from Java, the source of Blume’s type\nof A. diaphanum, have glabrous indusia”, whereas plants from the Philippines had setulose indusia\n13\n---PAGE 18---\nand hairy pinnae. He suggested that the hairy plants corresponded to A. setulosum, described by\nSmith (1846) from Norfolk Island. However, Bostock (1992) rejected this conclusion. He noted that all\n16 separate plants on three type sheets of A. diaphanum at L had at least some hairs on the laminae\nand “indusia”. He noted that there was “no justification whatsoever for using the name A. diaphanum\nBlume solely for plants with glabrous soral flaps”. He included Adiantum setulosum J.Sm. in the\nsynonymy of A. diaphanum, a decision also followed here.\nThe hairy and glabrous plants are treated as dimorphic character states within A. diaphanum.\nCheeseman (1906) interpreted the typical state of A. diaphanum as having hairy pinnae, and\nrecognised var. polymorphum, based on Colenso’s A. polymorphum, for the glabrous state. In any\ncase, A. polymorphum Colenso is illegitimate, being a later homonym of A. polymorphum Poir. (1810).\nFurther investigation is required to determine whether there is any genetic variation that supports\ntaxonomic recognition of different forms of A. diaphanum throughout its extensive geographical range.\nBostock (1992, 1998) noted that plants of A. diaphanum in Australia are not only tuberous but also\nproliferous, a feature recorded by Birkenhead (1886), enabling them to form small colonies. Although\ntubers are common in New Zealand plants, proliferation is unknown in herbarium specimens of wild\nplants and has only been observed in cultivated\nplants (http://www.nzplants.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/ferns/native-ferns/pteridaceae-maidenhair-\nannual-rock-brake-ferns/adiantum-diaphanum.html)."

    "recognition": "Adiantum hispidulum can usually be distinguished from all other maidenhair ferns in\nNew Zealand by its characteristic helicoid branching. A few plants are regularly 2–3-pinnate, and\nthese may be confused with divided forms of A. diaphanum, but they can be distinguished by their\nmore divided laminae and lack of tubers on the rootlets. Young fronds are also often tinged red when\nyoung.\nAdiantum hispidulum is dimorphic with respect to the nature of the hairs on the abaxial surface of the\nlaminae. Most plants have short, stiff hairs 0.1–0.8 mm long, but a few have longer, lax hairs 0.3–1.0\nmm long. Parris (1980) recognised the former as A. hispidulum and the latter as A. pubescens\nSchkuhr. However, in a detailed investigation of the two taxa, Large & Braggins (1993) found that the\ntwo taxa could only be distinguished on the basis of their hair characters, and even then there was a\nhigh degree of variability. They treated A. pubescens as a variety of A. hispidulum, and the dimorphic\nnature of the species can be recognised at this rank if required.\nVar. pubescens has a slightly different distribution to that of var. hispidulum. It is the only form that has\nbeen collected on the Kermadec Islands. Otherwise it is confined to Northland, with isolated\npopulations at Pouto, Kaipara Harbour and Piha (Parris 1980). Its distribution in this area overlaps\nentirely with var. hispidulum, but it does not extend to the rest of the North Island or the South Island.",
    "notes": "Further investigation is required to ascertain whether the differences in hair type on the\nabaxial lamina surfaces of A. hispidulum correlate with genetic differences in different parts of its\nextensive geographical range.\n21\n---PAGE 26---"

However C. tenuifolia is found in coastal regions of Queensland and Northern Territory,\nNepal, India, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia and the Pacific islands (Chambers & Farrant 1991).\nFollowing Green (1988), the name C. humilis (G.Forst.) P.S.Green was used as an earlier name for C.\nsieberi by Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (1989), but Chambers & Farrant (1991, 1998) concluded that\nForster’s type was typical of C. tenuifolia rather than C. sieberi.\nQuirk et al. (1983) noted that examination of the type specimen of C. erecta “shows it to be somewhat\nintermediate between C. sieberi subsp. sieberi and C. distans, with a narrow, mostly glabrous\n33\n---PAGE 38---\nbipinnate frond which bears some scales. Spores are rounded, and of an echinate pattern most like\nthat of C. distans”."

It grows from near\nsea level, reaching 190 m on Great Island, Three Kings\nIslands. In the South Island it occurs in lowland and montane\nareas east of the main divide, from the Marlborough Sounds to\nCentral Otago. It is found from about 20 m, reaching 1200 m\nnear Clyde.\nAlso Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria,\nTasmania).",
    "habitat": "Pellaea calidirupium grows on coastal cliffs, lava\nfields, dry rocky outcrops, bluffs, scree and roadside banks, either in the open, in crevices, under rock\noverhangs, under low scrub, or in rough grassland. It is often associated with Discaria toumatou,\nRubus rubiginosa, Thymus vulgaris and species of Sophora and small-leaved Coprosma. It grows on\ngreywacke, basalt, rhyolite, scoria, lava, schist, and rarely on limestone.\nTogether with Anogramma leptophylla, Asplenium flabellifolium, A. subglandulosum, Cheilanthes\ndistans and C. sieberi, Pellaea calidirupium forms a characteristic assemblage of ferns that inhabit dry\nrocky areas, especially in the eastern South Island.",
    "recognition": "Pellaea calidirupium is distinguished from most populations of P. rotundifolia by the\nappressed scales on the stipes and rachises, the more obviously dimorphic fronds, generally shorter\nlaminae (usually 30–240 mm long cf. 100–600 mm long), fewer pairs of pinnae on the fertile fronds\n(2–22 cf. 8–40), a sometimes enlarged terminal pinna, widely spaced proximal pinnae often borne on\ndistinct stalks, and sori that are continuous around the pinna margins and often confluent at the\napices. The fronds usually have an irregular and untidy appearance compared to the neat rows of\npinnae in P. rotundifolia. The fertile pinnae are characteristically triangular, or slightly falcate, with\ntapering apices, in contrast to the rounded or oblong pinnae with obtuse to acute apices abruptly\nnarrowed to a short, sharp point in P. rotundifolia.\nPellaea calidirupium is less easily distinguished morphologically from populations of P. rotundifolia on\nthe Kermadec Islands. The latter plants have more or less appressed scales on the stipes and\nrachises, so the distinction between the two species relies on the remaining characters outlined\nabove. Nevertheless, on the basis of molecular evidence, P. calidirupium is clearly distinct from\nP. rotundifolia on the Kermadecs and the North and South Islands (Brownsey et al. 2020).",
    "notes": "There is a striking disjunction in the distribution of P. calidirupium in the North Island.\nPopulations extend from the Three Kings Islands through eastern Northland to Mayor Island, but are\nabsent along the whole Bay of Plenty and east coast, reoccurring again only in the very south of the\nNorth Island. Given the apparent suitability of habitat along the eastern coast, further investigation is\nneeded to determine if the absence is real. There are no obvious morphological differences between\nthe two groups, and spore measurements suggest that they are uniformly tetraploid (Brownsey et al.\n2020).\n40\n---PAGE 45---"

    "recognition": "Plants of Pellaea rotundifolia on the main islands of New Zealand are distinguished\nfrom P. calidirupium by the presence of spreading scales on the stipes and rachises, less obviously\ndimorphic fronds, generally longer laminae (100–600 mm long cf. 30–240 mm long), more pairs of\npinnae on the fertile fronds (8–40 cf. 2–22), absence of an enlarged terminal pinna, less widely spaced\nproximal pinnae usually lacking distinct stalks, and sori that extend around the pinna margins but are\nnot confluent at the apices. The fronds usually have neat rows of pinnae compared to the irregular and\nuntidy appearance of those in P. calidirupium. The fertile pinnae are rounded or oblong, with obtuse to\nacute apices abruptly narrowed to a short sharp point, unlike those in P. calidirupium, which are\ncharacteristically triangular, or slightly falcate, with tapering apices.\nPlants of P. rotundifolia on the Kermadec Islands are slightly different morphologically to those on the\nmain islands in having more appressed stipe and rachis scales, although not as consistently as those\nin P. calidirupium. Distinguishing the two species relies on the other characters outlined above.\nHowever, molecular evidence shows that P. rotundifolia on both the Kermadecs and the North and\nSouth Islands is distinct from P. calidirupium (Brownsey et al. 2020).",
    "notes": "There are genetic and subtle morphological differences between populations of P. rotundifolia\non the Kermadecs and those in the rest of New Zealand, suggesting different origins for the two\ngroups. However, the exact nature of these evolutionary origins is unresolved at the present time, and\nthe morphological differences inadequately understood (Brownsey et al. 2020).\nThe Australian species Pellaea nana (Hook.) Bostock is morphologically very similar to P. rotundifolia.\nHowever, chloroplast DNA sequence data show that it is genetically distinct from both Australian\nP. falcata and New Zealand P. rotundifolia (Brownsey et al. 2020).\n43\n---PAGE 48---"

It grows from sea level, reaching 860 m at Huka Falls, near Taupō. It is found in lowland and montane areas throughout the South Island, but is uncommon in inland parts of Otago and south Canterbury. It grows up to 825 m on Mt Furneaux in the Marlborough Sounds and near Mt Cook. It extends to Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands.\nHovenkamp cited one specimen in U from Norfolk Island (A. Cunningham 33), but Green (1994) asserted that only one species, P. confluens, was present on the island. P. elaeagnifolia is treated here as endemic to New Zealand.",
    "recognition": "Pyrrosia elaeagnifolia is the only species of the genus present on the main islands of New Zealand, and is easily distinguished by its long-creeping rhizome; thick, fleshy, undivided fronds; dense covering of stellate hairs; and exindusiate sori arranged in several rows either side of the midrib.\nPyrrosia elaeagnifolia and P. serpens have both been recorded from the Kermadec Islands and characters for distinguishing the two are listed under the latter species.\nVery occasional aberrant fronds are found with lobed or bifid fronds, and sometimes the rhizome apices are fastigiately divided into multiple growing tips. The latter has been attributed to a gall-forming mite, Aceria sp. (Hovenkamp 1986, p. 178).",
    "notes": "New Zealand plants were previously referred to P. serpens (G.Forst.) Ching, but that species has ciliate rhizome scales, whereas those in P. elaeagnifolia are more or less entire (Hovenkamp 1986; Brownsey et al. 2021). The confusion arose because Forster identified New Zealand as the type locality for P. serpens, but his specimen is not conspecific with the species on the main islands of New Zealand. It was probably collected on one of the Pacific islands, and the specimen mislabelled (Hovenkamp 1986). P. serpens occurs across the Pacific from the Kermadec Islands and Fiji to Pitcairn Island.\nPyrrosia elaeagnifolia has been widely misidentified in earlier New Zealand literature under the names Polypodium stellatum Vahl, Polypodium serpens G.Forst., Niphobolus bicolor Kaulf., and Polypodium rupestre R.Br., and combinations based on them.\nCameron (2017) argued that, based on the original spelling of Elaeagnus latifolia L., the name \"eleagnifolia\" is an orthographic error that should be corrected to \"elaeagnifolia\". That spelling is adopted here."

It ranges from sea level to 550 m near Taihape, and to 650 m in the Raukūmara and Kaweka Ranges. In the South Island it occurs in coastal and lowland districts of north-west Nelson and the Marlborough Sounds, extending sporadically on the west coast to Fiordland and Southland, and on the east coast to Banks Peninsula. It is absent from Otago and inland areas of Canterbury and Marlborough. It reaches 400 m on Banks Peninsula and 450 m at Blue Duck Reserve in the Seaward Kaikoura Range. It occurs also on the Three Kings Islands and Chatham Islands. There is a 19th century collection from Stewart Island (WELT P005625), but Wilson (1982) states it is \"rare and local, as far south as Port Adventure\".\nAlso occurs in Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti, Marquesas Islands, Austral Islands and Pitcairn Island (Holttum 1964). Whether the Pacific Islands’ populations are genuinely conspecific with those in New Zealand requires investigation.\nThe species is reported to be naturalised in the Azores (Lehnert, pers. comm. 2011).",
    "recognition": "In the field Sphaeropteris medullaris is readily distinguished by its tall trunk with black hexagonal stipe scars, and large arching fronds with thick black stipes. The lamina and stipe scales have dark red setae along both margins, which distinguishes this species from all other native species. Even very young plants of Sphaeropteris medullaris can be positively identified by this character. The naturalised Cyathea cooperi has similar scales but is distinguished by its pale brown stipes and exindusiate sori. Plants of Cyathea cunninghamii are superficially similar to Sphaeropteris medullaris but have more slender trunks covered in appressed stipe bases, shorter and more lacy fronds, and thinner stipes. Cyathea cunninghamii also has scales that lack the marginal setae, and indusia that open to form a hood-shape, rather than splitting open irregularly.",
    "notes": "Cyathea polyneuron was described by Colenso (1879) from a plant he originally collected on Scinde Island, Napier. There are specimens in the Colenso Herbarium at WELT (P003306), in the Cheeseman Herbarium (AK 143439), and on two sheets at K. However, Allan (1961, p. 41) lectotypified the specimen at WELT, stating \"the type in WELT consists of three portions of a rachis bearing in all 20 secondary pinnae…\", a description which accurately relates to WELT P003306 (now on two sheets).\nCyathea medullaris var. integra was described by Hooker (1844–1846) from specimens collected by Colenso in New Zealand, but no material has been located at AK, K or WELT, which hold most of Colenso’s collections, and the type has been left undesignated (Brownsey & Perrie 2015)."
